***strict++***

Type safe C++20 numerical library. Offers customized analogues of built-in arithmetic types, flexible
fixed-size and dynamic arrays, compile-time prevention of dangling temporaries, lazy evaluation, 
numerically stable operations, extensive support for constexpr, and rigorous error handling. 
Documentation and additional functionality, such as N-dimensional arrays, is an ongoing work.
