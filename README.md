***strict++***

Type safe C++20 numerical library. Offers customized analogues of built-in arithmetic types, flexible
fixed-size and dynamic arrays, compile-time prevention of dangling temporaries, lazy evaluation, numerically stable operations, 
extensive support for constexpr, and rigorous error handling. Documentation, CMake integration and additional functionality,
such as N-dimensional arrays, is an ongoing work.
